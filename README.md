Editor profiles that comply with Dr. Michael Leverington's formatting requirements.

**Overview:**
Dr. Leverington's [guidelines](https://learn-us-east-1-prod-fleet01-xythos.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/5b6cbef360ea4/14002278?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27ProgramStandards_Java_v01.14.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20190910T224811Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=21600&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIBGJ7RCS23L3LEJQ%2F20190910%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=eef248f2b77cd3af6dfe0171b37332bf0677fcd832492e6a3691bd6a0d33570b) are extensive. Configuring your programming environment will make compliance easier and save you time formatting your code. **These profiles are built by volunteers, and come with _no guarantee of usability_**, so:
 - **Verify they work properly on your system before trusting your grade to them.**
 - _Please_ consider fixing any issues you find independently. We _love_ pull requests that fix bugs in our configurations just as much as new profiles you'd like to share.
 - If you find a bug and can't solve it, please raise an issue on this repo communicating clearly what is broken. Include software, version, and OS information.

**Usage:**
All editors and IDEs handle configuration differently. In some (Eclipse), you can import profiles. In others, you may have to copy/paste into a config file or similar. Not sure how to proceed? Ask the internet.


**Note:** Dr. Leverington requires that students in CS249 use IDEs rather than editors. Further, as of Spring '18, he can only help students with IDE-related issues if they are working in **Eclipse**. If you're not committed to a different IDE or editor, [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) might be a good choice for 249.
